# ProjectZelda

#Summary:
Top-down adventure game where the player explores dungeons to save people/get loot and better items. The game will have a hub world where they can upgrade tools and buy items. From this hub world the player can enter one of 5 themed dungeons. The dungeons will have pre-built rooms arranged in a random order (but the player will always be able to properly progress through the dungeon). While in the dungeons, players will fight enemies, get loot, rescue villagers, solve puzzles, and fight bosses.

#Rescue Villagers:
The hub world of the game is a village that is partially destroyed and the villagers have fled. The player explores dungeons to try to rescue villagers and rebuild the town. When the player rescues enough villagers and successfully escapes a dungeon, a new or upgrade building will become available that he can spend loot and upgrade/buy items. Villagers may give small quests or give hints about the dungeon. Some villagers when rescued will unlock new characters than have different stats/abilities. This will allow new playstyles as the player progresses through the game.

#Loot:
The game will feature some form of currency obtained by exploring/completing dungeons or kill enemies (TBD). This loot will be used at unlocked buildings to buy new items, possibly weapons, dungeon exploring tools, or potions with temporary effects.

#Enemies:
There will be a variety of enemies in the dungeons that the player must defeat to complete a dungeon. Each enemy will have a unique behavior and the player must employ unique strategies to defeat them. Some items/weapons may be more effective against certain enemies than others. Enemies will also be themed according to their dungeon. 

#Puzzles:
Some dungeons may contain puzzle rooms. Puzzles will offer rewards (TBD) when complete and may or may not be mandatory to progress in a dungeon (TBD).

#Bosses:
Each dungeon will have 1 or more bosses that must be defeated to complete the dungeon/ unlock the next dungeon in the progression. 

#Dungeon Themes (TBD):
  Forest
  Swamp
  Caves
  Castle
  Airship
